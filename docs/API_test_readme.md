### TESTING THE API

1. Clear Cache (if configuration was updated):

```bash
    php bin/console cache:clear
```

2. Test Token Generation:
Run:

```bash
    curl -X POST http://onlib.test/api/login_check \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"email": "admin@hotmail.com", "password": "MyPassword"}'
```

Expected response:

    {
        "token": "your_generated_jwt_token"
    }

3. Access Protected Route:
If you receive a token, try accessing the /api/books endpoint:

```bash
    curl -X GET http://onlib.test/api/books \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer your_generated_jwt_token" | jq
```

‚úÖ Expected Outcome:

    üîì Unauthenticated users can access /api/login_check to get a token.
    üîí All /api routes now require a valid JWT token.
    üîê Browser-based sessions (remember_me) work as expected for standard web routes.


### TESTING API FILTERS

Testing Filters Using curl. 

Filter by Title:

    
```bash
    curl -X GET "http://onlib.test/api/books/search?title=clean" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer your_jwt_token_here" | jq
```
    

This should return books with the word "clean" in the title.

Filter by Author:

```bash
    curl -X GET "http://onlib.test/api/books/search?author=martin" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer your_jwt_token_here" | jq
```

This should return books by authors with "martin" in their name.

Filter by Genre:

```bash
    curl -X GET "http://onlib.test/api/books/search?genre=Programming" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer your_jwt_token_here" | jq
```

This should return books in the "Programming" genre.

Combined Filters (Title + Author + Genre):

```bash
    curl -X GET "http://onlib.test/api/books/search?title=code&author=martin&genre=Programming" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer your_jwt_token_here" | jq
```

This will apply all filters simultaneously.
